# Demo and viewing the project

You can listen to sound samples of this synthesizer here: https://lassigithub.github.io/Python-synthesizer-sound-samples/  
You can view the project itself by clicking on the jupyter notebook file: "python_synthesizer.ipynb"  

# Description

This is a simple synthesizer created with python, as a jupyter notebook.   
A synthesizer is a machine that can make sounds. It makes different sounds depending on its parameters, which can be adjusted.    
I mainly used numpy and scipy libraries for this project.   

I've also made a machine learning project with this synthesizer.  
That can be viewed here: https://github.com/LassiGithub/Python-synthesizer-machine-learning  
However, I've added the trained model also into this notebook, and I use it to make predictions here.  

The sound samples webpage gives a good view of what the synthesizer can do.  
For the details of this project, you can check the jupyter notebook file.
